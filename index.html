    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given To the Church on September 23, 1979.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Rose sings "Rock of Ages."</i></p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Amen.  Amen.  Thank you, Lord, for the blood that saves us.  We worship you, Lord.  We adore you, Lord.  We love you, Lord.  Hallelujah, Lord, that you 
        called us to know thee.  For the great plan of salvation, Lord, thank you.  Thank you, Lord, for the redemption of our body, soul, and spirit, Lord, for the great plan of 
        salvation, the redemption of the world, Lord.  Hallelujah, that thou hast died that all men and women everywhere might be forgiven for all sin, Lord, that they might know thee 
        in the power of thy resurrection.  Hallelujah, Lord.  Praise your name, Lord.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">I thank you for this, Jesus, that you said the blood would never lose its power, Lord, but it will stand through the ages and ages and ages, Lord.  Thy blood is 
        sufficient for salvation of all men everywhere.  I thank you for this, Lord.  I thank you that you came in a flesh body, Lord, that you were willing to live on this earth among sin, 
        Lord, and could be a  pure sacrifice for our sin through thy blood.  Thank you, Lord, for such a plan.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Blessed Lord, praise your name, Lord.  Praise your name, Jesus.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.</p> 
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Through it all, the Lord has a plan that he is fulfilling.  That is what we are going to talk about – man and what God's plan is for man, and how far we have 
        missed the mark, the world in general.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 1</p>   

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now God is doing a work among his people, and he is not disappointed in what he is doing.  He is going to fulfill everything that his Word says he will fulfill.  
        And everyone that will accept it, God knows it in his heart and he will give them the opportunity.  Now that is for sure.  He will not let one that has a desire for him ever be 
        rejected.  He will never reject one.  And only he knows the heart.  With all of that, he stands by.  Just like he is here today.  Amen.  And I am happy.  I am really happy today 
        in the Lord because I know that he is here, and I know that he has anointed the Word, and I know that there are things in here that he wants us to know.  It will be some things 
        different from what perhaps some of us understand.  Just hang on.  If you are sincere with God and honest with God, it will be revealed to you in his time, Amen.</p> 

    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Adam was created in the image and likeness of God.  Now that is saying a whole lot.  They were pure, absolutely pure and holy and set over the works of God's hands.  
        I want to show you how limited Adam was, but there is another group that is coming along.  Amen.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>    Genesis 1:26-31</strong> </span> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    And God said,</strong>  After God had made all the cattle, and made the earth, first. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">     Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them</strong>   First he said 'let us make man' and then he said 'and let them' because he knew that there was 
        going to be a creation out here. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,</strong>  Now he limited 
        it to earth, did you see this?  He did not let Adam have rule over all of creation, over all the heavenlies and things.  But there is a man, Christ Jesus, that we will rule and reign 
        with, according to scripture; that will have dominion over all of the works of his hands, for Adam was limited. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    over all the earth,</strong>  That’s as far as he could go.
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God 
        blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, 
        and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in 
        the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the 
        earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  </strong> </p>    
   

    <p class="w3-justify">So they had everything that was upon the earth.  But that was as far as their dominion went.  Then with Christ, he said that he would give us dominion over all of the 
        works of his hands, not just the earth.  So this is no wonder that he said 'greater works than these shall ye do,' because Christ worked on the earthly plane also, as Adam had, as a 
        flesh man.  But you notice, the minute he stepped out of that flesh what happened to him.  He walked through doors.  He had dominion over every thing.  He appeared just anywhere out of 
        nowhere.  That was a different thing again.  Here is that complete likeness of God.  So there is a difference.  Now I can understand why he said 'greater works than these shall ye do 
        for I go to my Father'.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">We have not seen this yet, but it is coming, Amen, because the Word promised it.  We cannot just take a portion of this.  We have to take every bit of it, every bit 
        of the Word.  We have to take the whole thing.  Oh, we do not have to.  I mean we can go on blindly, but there is no limit to God.  There is no end to God.  He is forever and forever 
        and forever.  And there are things that we are just scraping the surface of, that is all – of the knowledge of God.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 2</p> 
    
    <p class="w3-justify">That little article I read about the galaxies and the black holes is just blowing scientist's minds at the expanse out here that they cannot even begin to figure out.  
        I can remember years ago when they thought they had it pretty well harnessed, that they knew just about how the earth was created and how man was created.  Now it is blowing their 
        minds because it is too big.  The bigger the telescope, the farther they see.  The more satellites they put up, the more is revealed.  It is clear out of man's hands now.  I heard a 
        Christian scientist on TV the other day, and he said that it is clear beyond anything that man can ever think.  He said the true scientists know that there had to be a Creator; that 
        this did not just happen, because it is too exact.  Everything is moving exactly in its proper orbit.  And everything is right on the second like the sun.  You set your clock by the 
        sundial, Amen.  You see, man cannot do that because we are just flesh, but it takes a God Almighty to do these things.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">So he put Adam over the works of his hands on the earth here, until disobedience came, then death and decay set in.  The minute they disobeyed God, the minute they 
        broke the commandment that the Lord told them not to eat of that fruit in the garden, the minute they went ahead and obeyed Satan when Satan tempted them, then the sentence of death 
        was set upon them and the decay of the flesh set in that beautiful creation.  And they were driven from the garden to go out and work as we do now, by the sweat of their foreheads, 
        by the sweat of their face.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">If we can see now what is happening here, God is about to bring a people back to have the dominion over all of the works of his hands, not just the earth.  This is 
        just one little speck as an example of God's creation.  And this is where it is at, right here on the earth for an example.</p>   
      
           
    <p class="w3-justify">This is where Jesus Christ came and died and shed his blood for our salvation: not just to save, although that is his greatest concern – the salvation of souls, but 
        that he might produce a people that would be so dedicated to God and so completely in the will of God, that God could transform them.  That they would become like unto the Son of God 
        himself, Jesus Christ: that by his Spirit he could dwell in them and completely take over this many-membered body out in the earth here, him being the head, because Christ was in God 
        and God was in Christ.  You cannot separate the two.  We know there are two, but they are one, in a sense.  Because they think alike.  They act alike.  He came in the earth to represent 
        the Father, didn’t he?  That is what he said.  He says he does nothing but to please the Father.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 3</p>    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">And instead of pure water or spirit, then it became bitter and sweet.  Like it says in James, bitter and sweet water should not come out of the same vessel.  It should 
        be all pure.  Now Adam became a flesh man, where before he was a spirit man.  He was made in the image and likeness of God.  So we know that he was a spirit man.  And when God breathed 
        the life into him, that was the spirit of life.  It was God's own spirit in Adam.  Then he gave him that commandment not to touch this thing, and he did.  So then God said, now you will 
        have to die for this.  And so everyone that is born since that time, is born under the curse of Adam.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">We have to be redeemed by Christ's blood.  We cannot even come in contact with God if we are not redeemed by the blood of Christ, which takes away all sin, forgives 
        all sin.  But then there is a work to do in us by the Spirit, that has to overcome all the nature of Adam in us.  That has to go.  All of this Adam nature must go, in order for us to 
        come into that relationship where Adam was, even to control just the earth.  Do you get what I am saying?</p>   
      
           
    <p class="w3-justify">Then we see in the earth, (I don’t know how the earth was.  It doesn’t say too much about it before Adam sinned.)  But then it said that thorns and briars and thistles 
        started growing in the earth.  That was part of the curse.  That is why he said he would have to till the ground by the sweat of his face.  And it choked out all the good, or spirit, 
        and death came to mankind.  All of these things, while they were growing – briars and thistles and things – out here in the field, there was also bitterness and hatred and all of these 
        bad things coming in his flesh nature.  He was pure, so it was a reverse action.  We are born like that, but that reverse action had to come in Adam, until he became worse instead of 
        better, because of the curse that came upon him.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">This man is again being restored into the likeness of the Father and Son through Christ's death and resurrection.  Now if he had not been resurrected, it could not 
        have been completed.  This process could not have been completed.  But he started out as a flesh man, a baby, and grew into manhood, and then gave his life for the sins of the world.  
        Then if he had just died, we could have been forgiven and that would have been the end of it.  There would have been no resurrection because he was the firstfruits of them that slept.  
        So when he was resurrected from the dead, he became the victor over death so that we would not have to die.  There will be a people that will be caught up, that will be with the Lord in 
        the spirit and they will not die.  And we know that that people is alive in the earth today.  We know that because we know that the timing in God is now, and according to the signs, we 
        know that this is true; that there will be many alive to the coming of the Lord.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">The process of Adam is being reversed.  We were born in sin.  So instead of, like Adam, coming from purity and going into sin, we are born in sin and become pure by 
        the obedience to the Word right here, with the Spirit, after we have accepted Christ, if we walk in the knowledge of the scriptures.  This is the only book we have that says anything 
        about God.  Many men have written many things about God, but that is not the Bible, Amen.  Only by the Bible, the only book that was protected and cared for by God and watched over.  
        I believe every word in this book, every one of them, Amen, because I have tried it and tried it and tried it.  I have proven that the Word is truth. Amen.</p> 
        
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 4</p>    
      
           
    <p class="w3-justify">We are born in sin in Adam.  And as we accept Christ, or the life giving Spirit, which Adam received after he was created and God breathed life into him, Christ starts 
        the reverse action.  Through disobedience, Adam started death working in him. And I want to tell you something else.  After we are saved and baptized in the Holy Ghost, and we continue 
        in sin, that reverse action starts again in us.  If we do not repent of that sin and disobedience, then that death reverse action starts out again in us.  We know some who have that 
        working in them; who have started and then back off and run back into the world.  We see that reverse action start to come in their lives, in their bodies, in their health.  All sorts 
        of things start happening to them.  That is that curse that was placed upon man.  It starts out again.  Sin causes it.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">Through Christ, we receive not only eternal life, but life.  Now I have scriptures for all of this when we get into the scriptures later on.  Through Christ, we 
        receive life and the process starts to change us back to that immortal being Adam started with.  Now here is the point that I want to get out.  He says when this mortal puts on 
        immortality, this mortal flesh, that is a flesh body, this mortal, we are mortal or flesh.  In the scriptures it says, "This mortal will put on immortality" that is, without death.  
        There will just be a change.  There will just be a change in the flesh.  It is very clear.  It is all through the scriptures.  You do not have to search hard to find it.  It is 
        everywhere in the scriptures.  And like I said, there is a people living today that will come into this immortality in God's timing, Amen.  Through obedience to the Word that God left 
        for us or pattern of examples from past history of men's lives.  Now we know the scriptures were given for instruction and so on and so forth and that all of these old happenings in 
        the Old Testament by holy men of God and the wicked also, were given for examples unto us.  The Word says so.  If we obey the truth in the Word, and what is the Word, didn’t he say the 
        Word is Christ?</p>
        
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>    John 1:1-5</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in 
        the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in 
        darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. </strong> Who did Jesus say he was?  The light of the world.  So we know what the Word is.  It is Christ.  And also, he is eternal life, 
        our very life, and he wants us to know we have to come into this place to where we know what he spoke to me, "Because I live, you shall live also."  He was not talking about just this 
        natural physical life or eternal life, but we have to become obedient to the place to where the very life that he lives inside of us is our very physical life as well.  We are being 
        changed daily in his life that is in here, just like the Spirit was in Adam.  That was his life until he sinned.  Now remember this is the reverse action.  We are gradually coming back 
        into that place to where that life that Adam had by the Spirit, by the breath that was breathed into him.  When you look at some people and it looks like they are getting younger, it is 
        because it is the life of Christ that is reversing the action of death in them.  It is the reverse action by a plan that God has.  Don’t ask me how he does it.  Who knows. </p>    

    <p class="w3-justify">I just know that the Word says that it happens, and that it is happening.  And that is his plan and we cannot change it.  We do not have to accept it, if we do not 
        want to.  We can be critics.  But if we just accept the simple Word of God like he wanted us to, then we can come into these things.If we accept the Word and obey the truth of the Word, 
        which is life, we will find our way back into that perfect relationship Adam had in the beginning, where sin and death are destroyed. The last enemy to be put down is death.  That is 
        scripture. That is the Word. Now if you cannot receive the Word for what it says, then there is no need of you listening, Amen.  But this is the Word of God. </p>   
      
           
    <p class="w3-justify">Now Jesus said that he died that all sin, sickness, death, and so forth could be overcome in him.  He did not die for each one of those things separately.  It is all 
        in the same package.  If you are saved, you have just as much right to claim a healing, victory over sin, and victory over death, and resurrection if you have died, to be resurrected 
        in the end.  That is all just one death.  He did not die a half a dozen times.  That was all in one package.  We have just gone on and not believed the Word of God.  We have a perfect 
        right to claim healthy strong bodies, a sound mind, Amen, the mind of Christ in us.  Sickness, sin, death, and resurrection: he died for those very purposes.  Now if he died for that, 
        I do not care if you know a millionaire friend and you are hungry and he says just help yourself and you do not do it, it is just the same thing here.  The Lord made all these 
        provisions for us.  But if we do not obey the Word, if we do not hear the Word, then we are the losers.  And that is the reason the children of Israel could not go on into Canaan.  
        We know that. Because of disobedience.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">And unbelief is the greatest sin.  When God tells us something, God Almighty who would never back up on his Word. I’m trying to keep quiet, but I’m stirring inside. 
        Because he has done so much for us and we do not accept it.  The most horrible thing is for God to make bold statements – I mean he has really made some rash promises in here – and for 
        us not to believe it and accept it.  It is like throwing cold water into his face, because we cannot accept his Word. How would you feel if you just continually promised your children 
        something and they just went on as though you had not even said a word?  They would say, "Daddy, can I have this?  Daddy can I have that?"  You would say, "Yes, yes, I promised it to 
        you.  Yes."  But they still never hear you and they say, "Daddy can I have this?  Daddy, can I have that?"  Wouldn't you soon get disgusted with them? You would feel like taking what 
        they did have away from them. Everything to make our way back to that relationship and beyond the relationship of Adam was in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

        there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is 
        also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the 
        dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</strong>  Do you see that?  If this is not real truth, that there 
        would be a resurrection, and Christ did not rise; if they say like the Jews say, that he was stolen; they stole his body – and that is what they believe to this day, that he was a 
        false Messiah – then our faith is in vain and we are still in our sins.  If he did not really rise from the dead on the third day like he said he did, then we are still in our sins.  
        We have no Savior. But we know that we have a Savior because our lives are changing and the desires that we used to have, we do not have anymore.  Amen.  We desire to be with God's 
        people.  That is the one way that you can tell, when you have that desire to be with God's people and you love God's people. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ

    <p class="w3-justify">Even though he died for our sins, if he had not been resurrected, we would just be miserable because we do not receive enough out of this life.  We are looking for 
        the life when we will be changed and become immortal. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</strong> He was the first one to come 
        back in a new body, in the heavenly body, the glorified body.  Do not forget that he ate with them and drank with them.  So we do not understand all of this, how a body that can take 
        food and digest it, can walk through the walls and appear and disappear, but nevertheless it is so, because the Bible says so.  He said when we look at the things that are seen, the 
        more real things are the things that you cannot see.  That is what he said, but we are so used to just these eyes that see everything, so we limit God to what we can see.  How stupid 
        we are. </p>

        Christ shall all be made alive.</strong>        Now do not let that scare you, because there is a death that he speaks of that is not a physical death, but it is a laying down of every 
        desire of the flesh.  That he calls death also.  We have to recognize the two when we see it.  Do you know what I am saying about that?  There is a place where he says we have to put 
        down every desire of the flesh.  Now we cannot do it by ourselves.  It is as we come to the end of ourselves and the Lord helps us to overcome these things in our lives.  And by his 
        Spirit, he can remove them, the old root of sin that is in our heart.  He can take it out.  We cannot.  All we have to be is obedient to him, obedient to his Word, obedient to his Spirit 
        when he talks to us, and he does the taking out, Amen, because we do not know how, because we do not see the Spirit, but the Spirit does the work. We are really more spirit than flesh, 
        if we only knew it.  Once you become a new creation in Christ, once you have accepted Christ, he says you are a new creature, a new creation.  So we are Spirit and flesh, but the more 
        we walk with God, the more we obey the Word, the more Spirit we become and the less flesh.  Now we know that is true.  We do not act like we did when we first gave our hearts to 
        the Lord.  Our lives are changing all of the time.  That is true as you walk with the Lord.  Some turn back.  We know that.  A lot of times you will fall and get up and shake yourself 
        and you bump your head a few times and then you start on your walk again.  Amen.  But through all of that, we are still growing.  We are growing into that perfect picture that he has 
        for this end time. I have said many times if people would have believed the Word back there, like Elijah when he was taken up without dying, and Enoch was taken without death, because 
        they had faith to believe.  But there has not been a people like this people that is coming forth.  I do not know in what form they (Enoch and Elijah) will come back – if they will come 
        back as Sons or what; I don’t know.  It is none of my business.  He did not choose to tell it in the Word, and we cannot just think about what might happen.  But we know that these Sons 
        that he is raising up today, that we call Sons of God, are an entirely different breed.  They are going back right into the realm of God to where they are going to be lifted right out 
        into a many-membered body, Christ being the head of that body.  Amen.  </p>

            we just walk to please the Lord regardless of how it looks, no matter how we act, as long as we know that we are walking in the Spirit to please the Lord.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">But made himself of no

            That is what he said, this many-membered body.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <span class="w3-text-red">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, 
            but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span> </strong>      Now this was before his death.  Do not get confused here.  This was 
            before he came back into the full authority that he had before he left and became a flesh man.  He was in the earth like we are today.  This was before his death.  Jesus was a flesh man 
            like us at this time and was an example for us to overcome death by the Spirit of life.  We do not have to die to come into this place – Jesus did – of full authority.  He only did it at 
            that time because he was a flesh man, although he was born of the Spirit.  His Spirit was of the Father.  And by the way, the blood comes from the Father and so his blood was pure.  This 
            is why he could be a pure sacrifice for sin because his Father was God.  So we are walking in flesh bodies with the Spirit of God in us.  If we have Christ, don’t we have the Spirit of 
            God and the Father in us?  You can’t separate the two.  Then we are in that same position.  It is about time that we woke up to that fact.  He said he could do nothing save that what he 
            would see the Father do. <span class="w3-text-red">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye 
            may marvel.</span> You see he did not know the end from the beginning here.  This is when he knew that he did just what the Father told him to do.  That was all. <span class="w3-text-red">
            For as the Father raiseth up the dead, </span> See, the Father did it. <span class="w3-text-red">and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no 
            man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath 
            sent him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life,</span> It is just as plain as can be. <span>and shall not come 
            into condemnation;</span> Do you know what condemnation is?  We always look at that as we have done something wrong.  The worst condemnation is death.  That is the worst condemnation 
            according to the scriptures.  And that is the last enemy to be overcome. <span class="w3-text-red">but is passed from death unto life.</span> This is all in that same package that he died 
            for.  And if you can’t receive it or can’t believe it, well, praise God anyhow.  I know what the Lord has spoken to me. <span class="w3-text-red">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour 
            is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span> Now he said they are dead in trespasses and in sins, too, didn't he?  
            So there is that kind of a life when the Spirit quickens the understanding and they receive life. <span class="w3-text-red">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to 
            the Son to have life in himself;</span> Well, where is that life now, pray tell me?  It is in the Spirit, and we have the Spirit, don’t we?  Oh, I know that this is just hurting, just 
            hurting.  But you had better get a hold of it if you are coming into immortality, Amen. We have this life also in us if we are heirs and joint heirs with Christ.  </p>

            earth with him. Well then, what are we saying?  What about the rest of it?  Just because it has never been taught.  We had better get a hold of it.  It is going to happen and we are
